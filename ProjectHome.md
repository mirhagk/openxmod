This project will encompass making an easy to use, fully featured 3D game engine in XNA. It will feature the use of actor based environments, with a trigger-event scripting engine that will allow mods to be constructed with no knowledge of C#. The game will look for files in an override folder to override the developers original files, and attempt to allow developers to provide all the tools neccassary for modding with little difficulty.
